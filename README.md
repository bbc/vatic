# INSTALLATION 

Installation into Pybossa on the R&D Public cloud. PyBossa lives in /opt/pybossa, and the build.sh 
script copies the static resources into the correct place. It relies on your ssh agent having access to 
the machine using the hostname pybossa, so set up your ssh config appropriatly.
